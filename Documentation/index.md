# Welcome to the MonoGame game library documentation hub.

This area of the site contains the documentation on the API of MonoGame as well as how to use it to create great games.

If you cannot find what you need here you can also look at the [Microsoft XNA documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200104.aspx). MonoGame is API compatible
with [XNA](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb203940.aspx) even down to the namespaces. So usually what works for XNA will work for MonoGame too.

The documentation site is made up of several major parts which are available as links at the top of the page.  

> If you are new to MonoGame, we highly recommend walking through the **[Getting Started](articles/getting_started/getting_started.md)** section to Install MonoGame and build your first game.
